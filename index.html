    <p class="solid">STEP 1: BASE</p>
    <h4>✿ E.l.f. Primer</h4>
    <h4>✿ Estee Lauder Foundation</h4>
    <h4>✿ Too Cool for School Finish Setting Pact</h4>
    <h4>✿ Too Cool for School Artistic Book (Contour, Blush, Highlighter)</h4>
    <h4>✿ Makeup Sponge</h4>
    <h3>After applying skincare to your face, apply the E.l.f. primer.</h3>
    <h3>Then, apply the foundation evenly on your face. Afterwards, using a makeup sponge, dab it all over your face to
      spread it out.</h3>
    <h3>In order to keep that foundation on all day, use a powder brush to set your face using the Finish Setting Pact
      from Too Cool for School.</h3>
    <h3>★ Set your face mainly on the T-zone area of your face (forehead, nose, and chin) because that's where it tends
      to get oily first</h3>

    <p class="solid">STEP 2: EYE MAKEUP</p>
    <h4>✿ Manga Lashes</h4>
    <h4>✿ Lash Glue</h4>
    <h4>✿ Eyeliner</h4>
    <h4>✿ Eyeshadow</h4>
    <h4>✿ Eyeshadow brush</h4>
    <h4>✿ Scissors</h4>
    <h4>✿ Eyebrow Pencil</h4>
    <h3>You first have to prepare your lashes.</h3>
    <h3>Take the lashes close to your eye and roughly measure the length of your eye to the lash.</h3>
    <h3>Cut the lash band according the measurement you made earlier.</h3>
    <p>★ Before applying the glue on the band, make the lash into a U-shape and twist it to make it rounder. It creates
      a better shape for your eye to sit on!</p>
    <h3>Apply the glue lightly onto the lash band.</h3>
    <h3>Wait until it gets tacky (20-30 seconds).</h3>
    <h3>Apply the lash on top of your actual lash line.</h3>
    <p>★ Curl your real lashes before putting the fake ones on to make it seem more natural!</p>
    <h3>Now eyeliner! There are several styles, like the image below shows.</h3>

    <h3>Apply eyeshadow on the water lid using the thin eyehsadow brush to create more depth, making the eyes look
      bigger.</h3>
    <p>★ You can also create "aegyosal" (or the fat underneath the eyes that show when you smile) using a lighter shade
      of eyeshadow to make your eyes look bigger.</p>
    <h3>Using the eyebrow pencil, outline the tails of your eyebrows and blend the inner parts of them.</h3>
    <h3>You can also apply highlighter on the inner corner of your eyes.</h3>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="solid">STEP 3: LIPS</p>
    <h4>✿ Lip Balm</h4>
    <h4>✿ Lip Tint (base/lighter shade)</h4>
    <h4>✿ Lip Tint (inner/darker shade)</h4>
    <h4>✿ Lipliner (*optional)</h4>
    <h3>Use lip balm first to make sure your lips aren't chapped.</h3>
    <p>★ Exfoliate your lips and moisture them before applying anything so that they doesn't look patchy or dry.</p>
    <h3>Apply the lighter shade lip tint all over ur lips.</h3>
    <h3>Apply the darker shade lip tint on the inner parts of the lips.</h3>
    <h3>Smack your lips together a few times to blend.</h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>★ If you want your lips to look thicker, you can overline them by using a lip pencil.</p>
